# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Recipe Management feature enables users to create, edit, and organize recipes within the NomNom meal planning application. This feature serves as the foundation for meal planning and grocery list generation, providing users with a comprehensive way to store and manage their culinary knowledge. Recipes are private by default but can be shared within families and optionally published to the community.
