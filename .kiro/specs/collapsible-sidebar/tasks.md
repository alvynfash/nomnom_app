  - Write widget tests for DrawerHeader display correctness
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Implement MainScaffold wrapper widget
  - Create MainScaffold StatefulWidget that wraps existing screens with drawer functionality
  - Add properties for currentScreen, title, actions, and floatingActionButton
  - Integrate AppDrawer as the drawer property of Scaffold
  - Implement navigation logic using Navigator.pushReplacement for clean navigation stack
  - Write widget tests for MainScaffold integration and screen wrapping
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 5. Add navigation handling and route management
  - Implement _navigateToScreen method that handles route changes and drawer closing
  - Add _getCurrentRoute method to determine active navigation item
  - Ensure proper navigation stack management with Navigator.pushReplacement
  - Handle system back button behavior appropriately
  - Write unit tests for navigation helper functions and route management
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 6. Update main app structure to use MainScaffold
  - Modify main.dart to use MainScaffold instead of direct screen navigation
  - Update MaterialApp routes to work with new navigation structure
  - Ensure existing screens (RecipeListScreen, etc.) work within MainScaffold wrapper
  - Maintain existing app bar functionality and floating action buttons
  - Test that all existing functionality continues to work properly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 5.3, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Implement responsive design and animations
  - Ensure drawer width is 280px as per Material Design standards
  - Implement smooth slide-in animation and backdrop dimming
  - Add support for different screen sizes (mobile overlay, tablet persistent mode)
  - Ensure drawer animations run at 60fps and feel responsive
  - Write integration tests for drawer open/close animations and responsive behavior
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Implement error handling for navigation failures with fallback to recipe list
  - Add error recovery for drawer interaction issues
  - Create user-friendly error messages with actionable solutions
  - Ensure proper widget disposal and state cleanup
  - Write unit tests for error handling scenarios and recovery strategies
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Implement accessibility features and testing
  - Add semantic labels for screen readers on all navigation items
  - Ensure keyboard navigation support for drawer interactions
  - Verify touch target sizes meet accessibility guidelines (minimum 44px)
  - Test color contrast ratios for all drawer elements
  - Write accessibility tests for screen reader navigation and keyboard support
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive test suite and integration tests
  - Write integration tests for end-to-end navigation flows through sidebar
  - Test screen transitions and state preservation during navigation
  - Verify deep linking compatibility with new navigation structure
  - Test drawer behavior across different screen sizes and orientations
  - Create performance tests to ensure smooth animations and memory management
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_
