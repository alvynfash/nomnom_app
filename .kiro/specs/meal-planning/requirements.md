# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Meal Planning feature enables users to create structured 4-week meal plans with configurable meal slots, assign recipes to specific days and meals, and save reusable templates. This feature builds upon the recipe management system to provide comprehensive meal organization capabilities. Meal plans are shared within families by default and can be applied to any calendar month for flexible meal scheduling.
